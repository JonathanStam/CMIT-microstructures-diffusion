CMIT microstructures diffusion

This is the repository for my project using diffusion models to generate synthetic microstructures. This repository is still in progress and as such there are still some key additions and changes to come.

So far there are 3 notebooks:
- model.ipynb containing the model class so that the weights can be loaded into it.
- image_analysis.ipynb which goes over how the image segmentation algorithm works.
- image_statistics.ipynb which looks at the distributions of the grains produced by the segmented images as compared to the target distribution.
